**Paper: WEIGHT CHANGES RELATIVE TO DIET SODA INTAKE OF PARTICIPANTS IN A
NUTRITION ORIENTED WEIGHT LOSS PROGRAM**

**1. What are the null and alternative hypotheses?**
Null hypothesis: that consumption of diet soda has no relation to consumer’s weight.
Alternative hypotheses: 
The nutrition program will reduce participant weight, waist circumference, and BMI.
Those who significantly reduce their consumption of diet soda will see better results (more significantly reduced weight, WC, BMI) than those who do not.
Those who didn’t drink diet soda before and do not drink it during the program will see the highest reduction in the three factors above compared to participants who drink ≥ 1 can diet soda per day.


**2. Who is collecting and analyzing this data?**
The study was conducted by one Kristen Amanda Lindorf for her master's thesis at Bowling Green State University in Colorado. The nutrition program that the participants followed was designed and conducted by Intermountain Health Care.


**3. What datasets does this study reference or use? Are these datasets available to the public?**
Section II of the paper, “Review of the Literature,” provides a comprehensive overview of existing literature concerning soda consumption, diet soda consumption, and the effects of soda and diet soda consumption on the body, including energy intake, risk of health problems, weight gain, etc. The paper’s bibliography contains 59 total references, most of them concerning one or more of the topics above. Much of the data/literature reviewed in this section concerns the comparison between sugary and diet soda consumption’s effects on weight gain. The paper makes use of a data table from "Fowler, SP, 2005. 65th Scientific Sessions- American Diabetes Association," which compares the risk of becoming overweight between diet and non-diet soda drinkers depending on how many cans are consumed per day. I found this study easily online.


**4. Why are they interested in this data?**
The author is interested in this research question because the high rate of obesity in the US and because of the sharp increase in that rate in the past few decades. Along with this rise has followed the rise of so-called diet products, sugar-free alternatives that claim to be a healthier alternative to junk foods, and the author seeks to investigate the verity of such claims. The author is interested in the data they reference in this section II because according to the author, there is much discourse over the question of whether or not these diet products are actually beneficial, hence why the author presents a variety of studies that discuss the sale of diet sodas, their possible effects, associated co-morbidities, and other possible causes of obesity.


**5. What data is being recorded? What data might be left out?**
The study first notes the participant demographics. The sample size was 40 participants, and the demographic data recorded encompasses participant gender, ethnicity, level of education, and yearly income, recorded by percentage of sample (i.e. 80.0% female). Data related to the weight of each participant was also recorded at the beginning and end of the study to evaluate the overall effectiveness of the nutrition program and to make conclusions about the relationship between diet soda consumption and weight. The variables used were weight (lbs), waist circumference (in), and BMI. Finally, diet soda intake was recorded in ounces based on participant self-reporting at the beginning and end of the program. The study fails to take into account any underlying health conditions of participants, doesn’t record diet soda consumption consistently during the program, and is also somewhat biased in the sense that diet soda consumption is self-reported by participants and therefore unverifiable.


**6. What evidence did they present to back up their conclusions?**
The study presents average changes in participant weight, waist circumference, and BMI pre- and post-program to establish whether or not the nutrition program overall was effective (which, based on that data, they concluded it was). The participants are divided into three distinct groups: those who drank diet soda during the program and didn't change or increased their intake, those who drank diet soda during the program, but decreased their intake, and those who neither drank diet soda before or during the program. The study then presented (self-reported) data to compare diet soda intake from the beginning to the end of the program. Lastly, they compared changes in weight, WC, and BMI between the three groups.


**7. How was this study funded?**
It’s unclear exactly how the study itself was funded. The study is the author’s master’s thesis, so it was likely funded through their university, Bowling Green State, but it isn’t explicitly stated in the study nor apparently online. However, the study does mention that participants had the option to be compensated for their participation in the nutrition program (which was run through the local hospital) through two insurance companies that partner with the hospital, who agreed to reimburse a significant portion of the course if the participant completed the course, met specific goals, etc.


**8. Do you think publish or perish had an effect on this study?**
It seems unlikely that the publish or perish phenomenon was a strong motivation for this particular study because again, this was the author master’s thesis. So the larger goal of the paper was to earn the author their master’s thesis, not merely to publish for the sake of continuing to receive funding. Though, on the other hand, one could argue that if a researcher seeks a higher degree to be able to continue a career academia, that researcher also probably wants to be able to secure funding and advance that career, which necessitates publishing, i.e. publish or perish.
